# forticare-api

Proof of concept python3 scripts using the FortiCare API to register Fortinet
registration codes and to retrieve license files.

# Before starting

Create in your working directory a `.forticare` in INI format as shown below

```
[forticare]
url = https://Support.Fortinet.COM/ES/FCWS_RegistrationService.svc/REST
token = NZTB-630M-OLYE-PPKG-4WWM-TL2A-WLZ2-0DJU
```
# Create a CSV file

It should have the following format:

```
# Use the '#' sign to comment a line
<registration_key>,<ip address>,<description>
```

For instance:

```
C6G36-V7TT7-DAE15-4EZ8T-U531B,192.168.244.200,FMG: SD-WAN orchestrator demo
D0UAB-FWEU6-MQ6A5-EVXZH-GHB1W,192.168.244.200,FMG: SD-WAN orchestrator demo
```

We are providing a python script to generate the CSV file out of the ZIP file we
receive from Fortinet when ordering our products.
The above CSV output has been generated by using the following command line:

```
$ ./generate_csv.py -f FMG-VM-BASE_27228669.zip -d "FMG: SD-WAN orchestrator demo" --ip '192.168.244.200'
C6G36-V7TX7-DAE15-4EZ9T-U531B,192.168.244.200,FMG: SD-WAN orchestrator demo
D0UAB-FWEX6-MQ6A5-EVX8H-GHB1W,192.168.244.200,FMG: SD-WAN orchestrator demo
```
